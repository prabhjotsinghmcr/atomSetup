# firefox-dev-dark-muted-syntax theme

A syntax theme inspired by the Firefox developer dark color theme with more muted/washed out colors that are easier on the eyes.

It is based on the syntax theme by [Or3stis](https://github.com/Or3stis/firefoxDevDarkSyntaxTheme), which is based on a theme by [maxbook](https://github.com/maxbook/firefox-dev-syntax). I also combined this with the sublime theme by [karelvuong](https://github.com/karelvuong/st-fox).

I take no credit on the development of the theme, I simply combined others' works into an atom package.
